# Dynamic Linear Models Analysis of S&P 500

- Forecasted time series of S&P 500 Index using Dynamic Linear Models, a Gaussian linear state-space model, based on uncertainty quantification
- Combined Dynamic Linear Models with random walk plus noise model and ARIMA model respectively and discovered that the prediction power of Dynamic Linear Models increases when combined with random walk plus noise model
- Evaluated model performance with Kalman filter, reverse smoothing filter, and one-step-ahead prediction
